# Featured Video Plus - WordPress Plugin #
Add Featured Videos to your posts and pages, just like you add Featured Images. Supports your Local Videos, YouTube, Vimeo and Dailymotion.

[On WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/featured-video-plus/)

## Description ##
*A picture is worth a thousand words. How many words is a video worth?*

This plugin enables you to define Featured Videos in addition to Featured Images. Themes using Featured Images automatically display the videos in place.

There are three ways to get the videos onto your page:
1. If your theme already makes use of Featured Images, these will automatically be replaced by Featured Videos if available. Alternatively you can
2. insert the `[featured-video-plus]` shortcode in your entries or
3. manually use the PHP functions in your theme's source files.

Beside your local videos (mp4, webM & ogg/ogv) you can use __YouTube__ (w/[time-links](http://support.google.com/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=116618 "Link to a specific time in a video")), __Vimeo__ and __Dailymotion__. If you miss a certain video platform: [Leave me a note](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/featured-video-plus).

The plugin adds some individualization options to your Media Settings. Beside aesthetic customizations you can turn off automatic integration and tweak some technical settings.
