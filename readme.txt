Add Featured Videos to your posts and pages. Works like magic with most themes which use Featured Images. Local Media, YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion.

== Description ==
*A picture is worth a thousand words. How many words is a video worth?*

This plugin enables you to define Featured Videos in addition to Featured Images. There are three ways to get the videos onto your page:

1. If your theme already makes use of Featured Images, these will __automatically__ be replaced by Featured Videos if available. Alternatively you can
2. insert the `[featured-video-plus]`-__Shortcode__ in your entries or
3. manually use the __PHP functions__ in your theme's source files.

Beside your __Local Videos__ (`mp4`, `webM` & `ogg/ogv`) you can use videos from __YouTube__ (w/[time-links](http://support.google.com/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=116618 "Link to a specific time in a video")), __Vimeo__ and __Dailymotion__. If you miss a certain video platform: [Leave me a note](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/featured-video-plus).

The plugin adds customization options to your Media Settings. Beside aesthetic individualizations you can turn off automatic integration and tweak settings regarding video sizing. By default videos try to dynamically fit their parent containers width.

= Shortcode =

	[featured-video-plus]
	[featured-video-plus width=300]

= PHP functions =
All parameters are optional. If no post_id is given the current post's id will be used.

	the_post_video(array(width, height))
	has_post_video(post_id)
	get_the_post_video(post_id, size(width, height))

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= After adding the URL and saving the post I do not get any video? =
Maybe the plugin does not recognize the URL. Take a look into the contextual help (button on the top right of the post edit screen). There is a list of tested URLs.

= How do I use my local videos? =
Take a look into the contextual help (button on the top right of the post edit screen).

= My theme uses Featured Images. Why are my videos not being displayed in place? =
For the videos to be automatically displayed you need to define a Featured Image. This image will never be shown if a video is available.
On the technical side your theme needs to feature [Post Thumbnails](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Thumbnails) and make use of `get_the_post_thumbnail()` or `the_post_thumbnail()`, because there is where the plugin hooks into.

If the automatic integration does not work, you can tell me in the [Support Forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/featured-video-plus) which theme you are using and I will take a look at it and might be able to develop a workaround.

= How can I make the videos fit the theme? =
Take a look at your media settings and try fixed sizes. For most installations the automatic sizing works fine. If tweaking does not help: [Tell me](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/featured-video-plus) which theme you are using.

= What about other video portals? =
Leave me a note in the support forums which you would like and I will consider adding them in the next release.

= How can I translate the plugin? =
Grap the [featured-video-plus.pot](https://github.com/ahoereth/featured-video-plus/blob/master/lng/featured-video-plus.pot) file, [translate it](http://urbangiraffe.com/articles/translating-wordpress-themes-and-plugins/) and post it in the [Support Forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/featured-video-plus). It will very lik be shipped with the next version.
