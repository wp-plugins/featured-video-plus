Add Featured Videos to your posts and pages, just like you add Featured Images. Works with every theme which supports Featured Images.


== Description ==

*A picture is worth a thousand words? What about a video then? How much more is it worth?*

This plugin enables you to define Featured Videos for your posts and pages. When Featured Images are supported by your theme the Featured Videos will automatically be displayed inplace if available. The Featured Image will be used as fallback.
The Featured Videos can either be displayed inplace of Featured Images, can be added to the theme by editing the theme's source files or inserted in your posts manually using the shortcode.

The plugin will add an box to the admin interface's post and pages edit page where you can paste your videos URL. At the moment the plugin supports __YouTube__ (including [time-links](http://support.google.com/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=116618 "Link to a specific time in a video")), __Vimeo__ and __Dailymotion__.
If you are missing a certain video platform: Leave a message in the supports forum.

After activating the plugin you will get some additions to your media settings. There you can choose how the videos will be sized and get some other individualisation properties - have a look at the [screenshots](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/featured-video-plus/screenshots/). If the theme you are using does not work with any combination of the width and height settings please contact me and I will look into it.

__Shortcode:__

	[featured-video-plus]
	[featured-video-plus width=300]


__PHP functions:__

	the_post_video(array(width, height), fullscreen = true)
	has_post_video(post_id)
	get_the_post_video(post_id, size(width, height), fullscreen = true)

All parameters are optional. If no post_id is given the current post's id will be used.


This plugin was created after using the original [Featured Video](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/featured-video/) plugin. Featured Video Plus is complete remake with more features and a more seemless integration into WordPress in mind.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= After adding the URL and saving the post I do not get any video? =
Maybe the plugin does not recognize the URL. Try the URL you get when clicking on share below a youtube video or the simple vimeo URL, which should look something like this: http://vimeo.com/32071937
If you want to you can post the URL which is not working in the support forums and the plugin might work with it in the next release.

= What about other video portals? =
Leave me a note in the support forums which you would like and I will consider adding them in the next release.

= Are there translations available? =
Not yet, but I will add translation capabilities soon. Interested in translating the plugin? Contact me!
